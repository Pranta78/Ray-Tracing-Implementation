# Overview

This project implements the following :
- **A fully controllable camera :** A fully controllable camera that allows the user to move forward/back/left/right, look left/right and tilt.
- **Creates plane and shapes of different structure**: takes information about the environment as input from a file and draws spheres, triangle, quadric surface, a 2d floor and two types of lights sources - spotlight and ambient.
- **Illumination with the Phong Lighting Model** : computes the ambient, specular and diffuse component of each object and light them accordingly.
- **Recursive Reflection** : reflection is computed recursively for an object according to the variable `recursion_level`.

# Language & Library Used
- `CPP`, `OpenGL`
